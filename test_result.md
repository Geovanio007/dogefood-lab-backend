# Test Results - DogeFood Lab Game

## Testing Context
- **Vercel Deployment URL:** https://app-eight-bay-35.vercel.app/
- **Backend API:** https://dogefood-lab-api.onrender.com/api
- **MongoDB:** User's MongoDB Atlas instance

## FIXES IN PROGRESS (2025-01-08)

### 🔧 Issue 1: "Wrong Network" Error on Mobile Wallet Browsers - FIXED
**Root Cause:** The network detection only checked wagmi's `useChainId()` which may not sync properly with mobile in-wallet browsers (like OKX).

**Changes Made:**
1. `frontend/src/hooks/useWeb3.jsx`:
   - Added support for multiple chain ID formats (number, string, hex)
   - Added direct `window.ethereum.chainId` check for mobile wallet compatibility
   - Added listener for `chainChanged` events from mobile wallets
   - Using `useMemo` for correct network computation

### 🔧 Issue 2: Restore Game Sound Effects - FIXED
**Root Cause:** Previous agent accidentally removed all sound effects when user asked to remove "tingling" sounds.

**Changes Made:**
1. `frontend/src/contexts/AudioContext.jsx`:
   - Re-implemented `playClick`, `playBrewing`, `playSuccess`, `playRare`, `playCollect`, `playLevelUp` functions
   - Added CORS-enabled audio sources for all sound effects
   - Sound effects now properly clone audio for overlapping playback
   - Effects volume properly respects user settings

2. `frontend/src/components/GameLabRedesign.jsx`:
   - Updated to use `playBrewing` function for mixing sounds
   - All audio triggers properly connected

## FIXES COMPLETED (2025-12-31)

### ✅ Issue 1: Guest User Username Banner Not Appearing - FIXED
**Root Cause:** The MainMenu.js was not properly detecting guest users from localStorage after registration.

**Changes Made:**
1. `frontend/src/components/MainMenu.js`:
   - Fixed guestUser state initialization from localStorage on mount
   - Added event listener for custom 'dogefood_player_registered' event
   - Fixed JSX syntax error (double `}}` bracket)

2. `frontend/src/components/AuthModal.jsx`:
   - Added custom event dispatch after successful registration
   - Event notifies MainMenu to reload guest user state immediately

**Test Result:** ✅ Profile banner now appears correctly with username, level, points, and guest badge after guest registration

### ✅ Issue 2: Telegram Detection Bug - FIXED
**Root Cause:** `isTelegramWebApp()` was returning true for regular browsers because `window.Telegram.WebApp.initData` existed as empty string.

**Fix:** Updated `/app/frontend/src/utils/telegram.js` line 14-16:
- FROM: `window.Telegram?.WebApp?.initData !== undefined`  
- TO: `window.Telegram?.WebApp?.initData && window.Telegram.WebApp.initData.length > 0`

**Test Result:** ✅ WelcomeScreen now shows correctly in regular browsers, enabling guest registration flow

### ✅ Issue 3: Points API Returns 500 Instead of 404 - FIXED
**Root Cause:** HTTPException was being caught and re-raised as 500 error.

**Fix:** Added `except HTTPException: raise` block to properly propagate 404 errors.

**Test Result:** ✅ `/api/points/{address}/stats` now returns 404 for non-existent players

### ✅ Issue 4: App.js Settings Component Override - FIXED
**Root Cause:** Local Settings component placeholder was overriding the imported Settings component.

**Fix:** Removed the local Settings placeholder function.

### ✅ Issue 5: TelegramAuth Component Not Rendered - FIXED
**Root Cause:** showTelegramAuth state was set but TelegramAuth component wasn't conditionally rendered.

**Fix:** Added conditional rendering block in App.js to show TelegramAuth when showTelegramAuth is true.

## Files Modified
1. `/app/frontend/src/components/MainMenu.js` - Guest user state management

    "username": "TestPlayer_176756461", 
    "guest_id": "guest_1e555940",
    "auth_type": "guest"
  }
  ```

### Key Findings:

#### 🎉 MAJOR SUCCESS: Guest User Bug Fixed
- **Primary Issue Resolved:** Each guest now gets unique ID (guest_xxxxxxxx) instead of "GUEST_USER"
- **Registration Working:** Guest registration flow is functional
- **Data Persistence:** Guest data properly stored in localStorage
- **Character Selection:** Working correctly for new guests

#### ⚠️ Minor UI Issues Identified:
1. **Profile Display:** Username and guest badge not showing in main menu profile section
2. **Navigation:** Some timeout issues when navigating back to main menu

### Conclusion:
**The critical guest user bug has been successfully fixed.** The main issue where all guests were identified as "GUEST_USER" is resolved. Each guest now receives a unique identifier in the format `guest_xxxxxxxx`. The core functionality works as expected, with only minor UI display issues remaining.

### Recommendations:
1. **Priority Low:** Fix profile display issues in MainMenu component
2. **Priority Low:** Improve navigation stability 
3. **Priority High:** Deploy these fixes to production as the core bug is resolved
